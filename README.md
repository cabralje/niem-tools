This is a <a href="http://bouml.fr">BOUML</a> "plugout" that supports mapping UML abstract class models to the <a href="http://niem.gov">NIEM</a> 3 framework.

<a href="http://mtgmc.com">MTG Management Consultants LLC</a> developed this UML-based tool for developing and managing NIEM architectures.  

The advantages relative to other tools include:

<b>Standards-Based</b> – Conforms to UML 2.0 and NIEM NDR

<b>Inexpensive</b> – An open source “plugout” module for BOUML, a low cost UML modeling program

<b>Simple to Use</b> – Supports round-trip NIEM mapping using a simple spreadsheet and doesn’t require knowledge of the NIEM-UML Profile

<b>Complete</b> – Captures UML process and object models and automatically generates HTML documentation, NIEM XML mappings, “want lists”, schemas, code lists, and Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) specifications

<b>Future-Proof</b> – Can import and migrate models to future versions of NIEM when released
