This is a [BOUML](http://bouml.fr "BOUML") "plugout" that supports mapping UML abstract class models to the [NIEM](http://niem.gov "NIEM") 3 framework.

[MTG Management Consultants LLC](http://mtgmc.com "MTG") developed this UML-based tool for developing and managing NIEM architectures.  

The advantages relative to other tools include:

<b>Standards-Based</b> – Conforms to UML 2.0 and NIEM Naming and Design Rules (NDR).

<b>Inexpensive</b> – An open source “plugout” module for BOUML, a low cost UML modeling program

<b>Simple to Use</b> – Supports round-trip NIEM mapping using a simple spreadsheet and doesn’t require knowledge of the NIEM-UML Profile

<b>Complete</b> – Captures UML process and object models and automatically generates HTML documentation, NIEM XML mappings, “want lists”, schemas, code lists, and Web Service Definition Language (WSDL) and OpenAPI service definitions.

<b>Future-Proof</b> – Can import and migrate models to future versions of NIEM when released
